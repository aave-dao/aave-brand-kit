# Logo

## Ghost Logomark

The Ghost Logomark stands at the heart of Aave's visual identity, embodying the brand across all platforms.

This Logomark reimagines the classic Aave ghost symbol to maintain Aave's image uniformly, whether in print or digital form, and regardless of size.

Crafted from sleek, circular designs, the logomark acts as the foundation for a broader and richer visual identity that includes typefaces, brand accents, and illustrations.

## Aave Wordmark

The Ghost Logomark is supported and extended by the Aave wordmark.

Set in lowercase, the wordmark is designed to mimic the aesthetics of the logomark. The clean geometric forms of the wordmark utilize the same circular profile established within the Ghost Logomark.

## Aave Logo

The full Aave Logo is a combination of the Ghost Logomark and the
Aave wordmark.

## Aave Logo Construction

There are multiple ways to utilize
all elements of the Aave logo.

Both the Ghost Logomark and the Aave Wordmark can stand alone
or be combined to create the full
Aave Logo.

## Ghost Logomark Variations

A delightful feature of the Ghost Logomark is its ability to showcase
a spectrum of emotions through the ghost's facial expressions.

While these variations of the logomark should not replace the primary symbol, they can enhance personality in specific situations, such as animated content.

## Derivative Logos

Community assets are derivatives of the main Aave logo and can be used by the community as needed.

For example, if youâ€™re throwing an Aave related event, you may want to use the Aave Events logo rather than the standard Aave logo, for clarity.

### Community

The Community ghost features
star-shaped eyes.
