# Logo

## Ghost Logomark

The Ghost Logomark stands at the heart of Aave's visual identity, embodying the brand across all platforms.

This Logomark reimagines the classic Aave ghost symbol to maintain Aave's image uniformly, whether in print or digital form, and regardless of size.

Crafted from sleek, circular designs, the logomark acts as the foundation for a broader and richer visual identity that includes typefaces, brand accents, and illustrations.

## Aave Wordmark

The Ghost Logomark is supported and extended by the Aave wordmark.

Set in lowercase, the wordmark is designed to mimic the aesthetics of the logomark. The clean geometric forms of the wordmark utilize the same circular profile established within the Ghost Logomark.

## Aave Logo

The full Aave Logo is a combination of the Ghost Logomark and the
Aave wordmark.

## Aave Logo Construction

There are multiple ways to utilize
all elements of the Aave logo.

Both the Ghost Logomark and the Aave Wordmark can stand alone
or be combined to create the full
Aave Logo.

## Token Logo

The Aave Token Logo is created by positioning the original Ghost Logomark inside a circular container.

## Profile Picture

The Aave Profile Picture is created by positioning the original Ghost Logomark inside a circular container.

## Ghost Logomark Variations

A delightful feature of the Ghost Logomark is its ability to showcase
a spectrum of emotions through the ghost's facial expressions.

While these variations of the logomark should not replace the primary symbol, they can enhance personality in specific situations, such as animated content.

## Derivative Logos

Community assets are derivatives of the main Aave logo and can be used by the community as needed.

For example, if you’re throwing an Aave related event, you may want to use the Aave Events logo rather than the standard Aave logo, for clarity.

### Community

The Community ghost features
star-shaped eyes.

### Events

The Events ghost features heart-shaped eyes.

![](/Readme/aave-events.png)

### DAO

The DAO ghost features
rhombus-shaped eyes.

![](/Readme/aave-dao.png)

The derivative logos are constructed from three core elements:

A. Specific Ghost Logomark variation.

B. The original Aave Wordmark.

C. Specific derivative wordmark based on the original Aave lettering.

## Derivative Logo PFPs

Every segment of the Aave universe is paired with distinct color schemes, detailed later in this document.

# Colors

## Primary Palettes

The Aave primary palette comprises two key scales: Gray and Purple.

This primary palette forms the fundamental color scheme of the brand and is intended for use in all critical visual communications for Aave, including the Ghost Logomark and the Aave Wordmark.

![](/Readme/primary-palettes.png)

## Extended Palettes

Colors from the extended palette are used for illustrations and derivative logos.

![](/Readme/secondary-palettes.png)

## Logo Colorways

The Aave logo can be paired with most colors outlined in this guideline; however, it is recommended to predominantly use limited logo colorways derived from the primary color palette, as illustrated in the examples.

![](/Readme/logo-colorways.png)

## Derivative Palettes

Each Aave derivative (Community, Events, DAO) has its own unique custom color palette.

While white from the primary color palette can be used across all derivatives, the rest of the colors should be allocated to their respective derivatives.

# Typeface

## Brand Typeface

The Aave brand typeface, FT Regola Neue by Formula Type, merges geometric and grotesque elements into a geo-grotesque style.

Its circular profile complements the semicircular shapes common across the brand's various elements.

![](/Readme/brand-typeface.png)

## Brand Typeface Weights

FT Regola Neue comes in a set of different weights:

- Regular
- Medium
- Semibold
- Bold
- Italic

![](/Readme/brand-typeface-weights.png)

## Alternative Glyphs

FT Regola Neue offers two alternative glyphs for the letter 'a':

- Double-storey
- Single-storey

The single-storey 'a' should always be used in Aave’s visual communications.

The alternative shapes of the 'a' can be accessed via OpenType settings.

![](/Readme/alternative-glyphs.png)

## Typeface Hierarchy

Each weight of the brand typeface should be used considering a particular hierarchy.

### Regular

Regular should be used for larger bodies of text and descriptions.

### Medium

Medium can be used for both, larger bodies of text and headlines.

### Semibold

Semibold usage should be reserved only for headlines or highlighting specific parts of a text.

![](/Readme/typeface-hierarchy.png)

## Using Brand Typeface

- Headlines should be set in either Regola Medium or Regola Semibold.
- Body text should be set in Inter.

# Illustrations

## The Semicircle

The semicircle is a modular brand accent, originating from the Aave Ghost Logomark's initial shape.

This simple graphic element can be versatilely employed to complement and enhance the other visual assets.

![](/Readme/the-semicircle.png)

## Using The Semicircle

The semicircle can be used in
a variety of ways:

1. Used as a stand-alone element.
2. Repeated, layered and rotated.
3. Overlapped to form more complex pattern elements.

![](/Readme/using-the-semicircle.png)

The modularity of the semicircle allows for total control over the complexity of patterns.

The patterns can vary from very simple to detailed.

![](/Readme/using-the-semicircle-cont.png)

The Semicircle element can be paired with text.
Text can be placed below, above
or next to the semicircular elements.

Avoid overlapping text and semicircles.

![](/Readme/using-the-semicircle-with-text.png)

## Illustrations

Another significant brand feature is a collection of illustrations depicting Ronnie, a friendly ghost mascot.

These illustrations can function as purely decorative elements or be employed to elucidate different facets of the Aave universe.

![](/Readme/ronnie-1.png)

Illustrations come in various
degrees of complexity and detail

![](/Readme/ronnie-2.png)

The illustrations are semitransparent and will blend with solid background colors.
